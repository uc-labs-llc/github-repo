• Repo Name: Enter a unique name (e.g., reporocket-test-13000).
• Access Token: Paste your GitHub PAT.

3. Optional Fields:
• Repo URL: Auto-filled after creation (view-only).
• Branch Name: Defaults to main—edit if needed.
• Description: Add a repo description.
• Template: Choose empty, python, or nodejs for pre-filled files (e.g., .gitignore).
• Private Repository: Check to make the repo private.
• SSH Key Path/Content: For SSH-based Git operations (optional).
• Clone Command/Remote Name: Auto-filled (view-only).
• Username/Email: Used for Git commits—defaults to unknown if blank.
• Last Commit Hash: Auto-filled after commits (view-only).
• Notes: Add personal notes (not sent to GitHub).

4. Launch: Click "Launch Repo"—RepoTinker will:
• Create the local directory.
• Initialize a Git repo with an initial README.md.
• Apply the selected template.
• Create the GitHub repo using your PAT.
• Push the initial commit to GitHub.
• Display a success message with the repo URL.
Editing a Repository

1. Browse Directory:• In the "Edit Repo" section, click "Browse" to select your repo’s local directory
(e.g., /home/cliff/reporocket-test-13000).
• Files will appear in the "Files" list (excludes .git).

2. Edit Files:
• Select a file (e.g., README.md)—its contents load in the text editor.
• Make changes directly in the editor.

3. Save Changes:
• Click "Save File" to write changes to the local file.

4. Commit & Push:
• Click "Commit & Push"—RepoTinker will:
• Stage all changes (git add .).
• Commit with a message ("Update via RepoTinker").
• Push to GitHub using your stored PAT—no prompts!
• Success message confirms the push.

Resetting the Form
• Clear Form: Click "Clear Form" to reset all fields, the editor, and session credentials.
• You’ll need to re-enter your PAT and username to commit/push again.

Limitations
• Git Version: Requires Git 2.28+ (for main branch support).
• Logo Support: Only PNG/GIF logos (300x100px) are supported natively by Tkinter—
JPEG won’t work.

• Single Repo at a Time: RepoRocket manages one repo per session—clear the form to start
a new one.
• Internet Required: Needs an active internet connection to interact with GitHub.
• No Advanced Git Features:
• No branch switching, merging, or pull requests—basic commit/push only.
• No Git history viewing—use a Git client for advanced operations.
• Platform: Tested on Linux (e.g., Ubuntu)—Windows/Mac may need path adjustments (e.g.,
C:\\Users\my-repo).
• Error Handling:
• Invalid PATs or duplicate repo names will show GitHub error messages.
• Ensure your PAT has repo scope, or creation will fail.
